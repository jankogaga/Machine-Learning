# Machine-Learning
This is a portfolio for Machine Learning taks written in Python.

Handwritten digits.py
represents Neural Network using Keras Python library.
Dataset used is built-in digit dataset. This dataset is made up of 1797 8x8 images. Each image, like the one shown below, is of a hand-written digit.
For the training the network, we will use logarithmic loss, which for a binary classification problem is defined in Keras as “binary_crossentropy“. We will also use the efficient gradient descent algorithm “adam” for no other reason that it is an efficient default. 
For just 10 iterations, accuracy of the network reaches 99.77%
In the end, the neural network chooses 3 random examples from dataset and makes a prediction for them.
